            Alauddin Khilji launched the most extensive and devastating military campaigns of any ruler of the Delhi Sultanate. Driven by an insatiable desire for plunder, territorial expansion, and the subjugation of Hindu kingdoms, his armies swept across the entire Indian subcontinent between 1299 and 1311 CE.
          </p>
          <p>
            No previous Sultan had attempted conquests on this scale. While earlier rulers like Qutbuddin Aibak and Iltutmish had consolidated power in northern India, Khilji's ambitions stretched far beyond the Indo-Gangetic plains. His campaigns penetrated deep into the Deccan, the Malabar coast, and the extreme south of the peninsula &mdash; territories that no Delhi-based ruler had ever reached before.<sup><a href="sources.html#khusrau-khazain" class="citation">[2]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            The military machinery that made this possible was vast. Khilji maintained one of the largest standing armies in the medieval world, estimated at over 300,000 cavalry and an even larger body of infantry. His genius lay not just in brute force but in the appointment of capable and ruthless commanders &mdash; foremost among them Malik Kafur, a Hindu convert captured during the Gujarat campaign who rose from the status of a slave to become the Sultan's most trusted general and the architect of the devastating southern invasions.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani-tarikh" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            Each campaign followed a grim pattern: siege or swift assault, the destruction of temples and cultural sites, massive plunder of treasury and valuables, enslavement of populations, and the imposition of Sultanate authority over the defeated kingdom. The wealth extracted from these conquests &mdash; gold, diamonds, pearls, elephants, horses &mdash; was channeled back to Delhi, funding Khilji's monumental building projects and his enormous military apparatus.

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The invasion of Gujarat in 1299 CE was one of Alauddin Khilji's earliest major campaigns and set the tone for the devastation that would follow. The Sultan dispatched two of his most capable generals &mdash; his brother Nusrat Khan (Nusrat Khan Jalesari) and his nephew Ulugh Khan (Alp Khan) &mdash; at the head of a massive army to subdue the prosperous Vaghela dynasty of Gujarat, then ruled by Rai Karan Dev II.<sup><a href="sources.html#khusrau-khazain" class="citation">[2]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <h3 data-aos="fade-up">Sack of Anhilwara</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The Khilji forces swept into Gujarat with overwhelming strength. Rai Karan Dev, unable to mount an effective defense against the Sultanate's vast cavalry, fled his capital Anhilwara Patan (modern Patan in Gujarat) without offering significant resistance. The city was sacked and its wealth seized. The royal treasury, accumulated over centuries of Solanki and Vaghela rule, was emptied. Temples across the city were plundered and destroyed.<sup><a href="sources.html#isami-futuh" class="citation">[3]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <h3 data-aos="fade-up">Destruction of the Somnath Temple</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The army then marched to Somnath, the sacred temple complex on the coast of Saurashtra that had been painstakingly rebuilt after Mahmud of Ghazni's infamous raid in 1026 CE. The Hindu community had spent generations restoring this revered Jyotirlinga shrine. Nusrat Khan's forces demolished the temple once again, stripping it of its wealth and desecrating its sanctum. This was the third major destruction of Somnath &mdash; a blow that carried profound symbolic weight for the Hindu population of Gujarat.<sup><a href="sources.html#khusrau-khazain" class="citation">[2]</a></sup>

          <h3 data-aos="fade-up">Capture of Malik Kafur</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            One of the most consequential outcomes of the Gujarat campaign was the capture of a young Hindu convert slave named Malik Kafur (also known as Hazar-Dinari, meaning "worth a thousand dinars," a reference to the price paid for him). Kafur was reportedly captured by Nusrat Khan at the port of Khambhat (Cambay). He was presented to Alauddin Khilji in Delhi and quickly rose to become the Sultan's most favored companion and, eventually, his supreme military commander. Kafur would go on to lead the devastating southern campaigns that extended Khilji's reach to the very tip of the Indian peninsula.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani-tarikh" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <h3 data-aos="fade-up">Outcome</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Gujarat was brought firmly under Sultanate control. Rai Karan Dev fled to the Yadava kingdom of Devagiri. The immense wealth plundered from Gujarat &mdash; gold, silver, jewels, textiles, horses, and elephants &mdash; was transported back to Delhi. The campaign established a pattern that Khilji would repeat across India: swift invasion, temple destruction, mass plunder, and the installation of Sultanate governors over conquered territories.

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The fortress of Ranthambore, perched atop a steep hill in present-day Rajasthan, was considered one of the most impregnable strongholds in India. It was held by the Chahamana (Chauhan) Rajput king Hammir Dev (Hammiradeva), a proud and defiant ruler who had sheltered Mongol refugees &mdash; former soldiers who had deserted from Khilji's army after a failed Mongol invasion &mdash; and refused to hand them over to the Sultan. This act of defiance gave Khilji the pretext he needed to launch a full-scale siege.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani-tarikh" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <h3 data-aos="fade-up">The Siege</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Khilji initially sent Nusrat Khan and Ulugh Khan to capture Ranthambore. The initial assault was a disaster for the Sultanate forces &mdash; Nusrat Khan was killed during the fighting, struck by a projectile from the fort's defenders. The death of a senior commander enraged Alauddin, who personally marched to Ranthambore with the bulk of his army to take command of the siege.<sup><a href="sources.html#isami-futuh" class="citation">[3]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Despite months of siege, the mighty fortress held firm. Hammir Dev's garrison, though vastly outnumbered, exploited the natural defenses of the hill fort to devastating effect. Direct assault was nearly impossible.
          </p>

          <h3 data-aos="fade-up">Treachery and Fall</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The fort ultimately fell not through military might but through treachery. Several of Hammir Dev's own commanders &mdash; most notably Ranmal and Ratipala &mdash; were bribed or coerced into defecting to Khilji's side. With critical sections of the defense compromised from within, the Sultanate forces breached the walls. Hammir Dev fought to the death in the final battle rather than surrender.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani-tarikh" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <h3 data-aos="fade-up">Jauhar</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            As the fall of the fortress became inevitable, the Rajput women of Ranthambore performed jauhar &mdash; the practice of mass self-immolation to preserve their honor and avoid capture, enslavement, or worse at the hands of the invading army. This act of supreme sacrifice would be repeated at Chittor just two years later on an even more devastating scale.<sup><a href="sources.html#khusrau-khazain" class="citation">[2]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <div class="callout callout--warning" data-aos="fade-up">
            <div class="callout__title">Historical Note</div>
            <p class="callout__text">
              The traitors Ranmal and Ratipala, who had betrayed their king hoping for rewards from Khilji, were themselves executed by the Sultan shortly after the fall of the fort. Khilji reportedly despised traitors even when he benefited from their treachery &mdash; a grim reminder of the Sultan's ruthless pragmatism.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 data-aos="fade-up">Outcome</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Ranthambore was absorbed into the Delhi Sultanate. The fall of this legendary fortress sent shockwaves through Rajputana, demonstrating that no stronghold was safe from Khilji's reach. The Chahamana dynasty, which had ruled the region since the days of Prithviraj Chauhan, was effectively extinguished.

            The siege of Chittor (Chittorgarh) in 1303 CE stands as one of the most infamous episodes in Indian medieval history. Chittor was the capital of the Guhila (Sisodia) Rajput kingdom of Mewar, ruled by Rawal Ratan Singh (Ratnasimha). It was one of the largest and most heavily fortified hill forts in India, a symbol of Rajput pride and resistance.<sup><a href="sources.html#khusrau-khazain" class="citation">[2]</a></sup>

          <h3 data-aos="fade-up">The Legend of Rani Padmini</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The most famous narrative surrounding the siege involves Rani Padmini (Padmavati), the legendary queen of Rawal Ratan Singh, whose extraordinary beauty is said to have driven Alauddin Khilji to launch the siege. This story, immortalized in Malik Muhammad Jayasi's epic poem <em>Padmavat</em> (1540 CE), describes how Khilji became obsessed with possessing Padmini after glimpsing her reflection in a mirror. While historians debate the historicity of Padmini herself &mdash; she does not appear in Amir Khusrau's contemporary account &mdash; the siege and its catastrophic aftermath are thoroughly documented in primary sources.<sup><a href="sources.html#jayasi-padmavat" class="citation">[7]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <h3 data-aos="fade-up">The Siege</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Alauddin Khilji personally led a massive army to Chittor and laid siege to the fortress. The siege lasted several months. The Rajput defenders fought with extraordinary valor, conducting sorties and inflicting heavy casualties on the besieging army. However, the overwhelming numbers and resources of the Sultanate forces, combined with the gradual exhaustion of Chittor's supplies, made the outcome inevitable.<sup><a href="sources.html#khusrau-khazain" class="citation">[2]</a></sup>

          <h3 data-aos="fade-up">The Jauhar of Chittor</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            As the fall of Chittor became certain, the Rajput women of the fortress &mdash; led, according to tradition, by Rani Padmini herself &mdash; performed the most famous act of jauhar in Indian history. Thousands of women, along with their children, immolated themselves on a massive funeral pyre within the fort rather than face capture and dishonor at the hands of the invaders. The men, knowing their families were beyond the reach of the enemy, then donned saffron robes and rode out to fight to the death in a final suicidal charge (saka).<sup><a href="sources.html#khusrau-khazain" class="citation">[2]</a></sup>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            After the conquest, Khilji deliberately erased the identity of Chittor. He renamed the city Khizrabad after his eldest son Khizr Khan and installed a Sultanate governor. The renaming was a calculated act of cultural annihilation &mdash; an attempt to erase the Rajput heritage of the city from historical memory. However, the Rajputs would eventually reclaim Chittor under Rana Hammir Singh in 1326 CE, a decade after Khilji's death.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani-tarikh" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>

            The siege of Chittor was the most traumatic military event of Khilji's reign. Its memory endures in Rajput cultural consciousness to this day. The jauhar at Chittor became a powerful symbol of resistance and sacrifice, commemorated in song, poetry, and folklore for seven centuries.

            In 1305 CE, Alauddin Khilji dispatched his general Ain-ul-Mulk Multani to conquer the kingdom of Malwa in central India, then ruled by the Paramara Rajput dynasty. Malwa occupied a strategic position between northern India and the Deccan, and its subjugation was essential for Khilji's planned southern campaigns.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani-tarikh" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>

            The Sultanate forces overwhelmed the Paramara defenses. The fortress of Mandu, the stronghold of the Malwa kingdom, fell after a brief resistance. The ancient and sacred city of Ujjain &mdash; one of the seven holiest cities in Hinduism (Sapta Puri) and home to the revered Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga temple &mdash; was also captured and subjected to widespread destruction.<sup><a href="sources.html#isami-futuh" class="citation">[3]</a></sup>

            Temples across Malwa were demolished or desecrated. The wealth accumulated in these ancient shrine cities over centuries was plundered and sent to Delhi. The Paramara dynasty, which had patronized Sanskrit learning and Hindu temple architecture for generations, was brought to an end. Malwa was incorporated into the Delhi Sultanate as a province.

            The conquest of Malwa eliminated the last major Hindu power in central India standing between the Sultanate and the Deccan kingdoms. It secured the land route that Malik Kafur would use for his sweeping southern invasions in the following years. The cultural and religious destruction inflicted on Ujjain and Mandu represented yet another chapter in the systematic erasure of Hindu heritage under Khilji's rule.

            Devagiri (modern Daulatabad in Maharashtra) was the capital of the Yadava (Seuna) dynasty, one of the most powerful Hindu kingdoms of the Deccan. Alauddin Khilji had first raided Devagiri in 1296 CE &mdash; even before becoming Sultan &mdash; extracting massive tribute from its ruler Ramachandra Dev (Ramadeva). However, the Yadava king had subsequently stopped paying the promised tribute, prompting Khilji to dispatch Malik Kafur with a large army to reassert Sultanate authority.<sup><a href="sources.html#khusrau-khazain" class="citation">[2]</a></sup>

            Khilji adopted a pragmatic approach with Devagiri. Rather than annexing the kingdom outright, he reinstated Ramachandra Dev as a vassal ruler, bestowing upon him the title "Rai Rayan" (King of Kings) &mdash; but only on the condition of absolute obedience and the regular payment of massive tribute. The Yadava kingdom was effectively reduced to a client state of Delhi. This strategic arrangement would prove invaluable: Devagiri served as the staging base for Malik Kafur's subsequent campaigns deeper into southern India, against Warangal, Dvarasamudra, and Madurai.<sup><a href="sources.html#khusrau-khazain" class="citation">[2]</a></sup>

            The campaign against Warangal targeted the Kakatiya dynasty, one of the greatest Telugu dynasties, which ruled a prosperous kingdom from their capital at Warangal (Orugallu) in present-day Telangana. The Kakatiyas, under King Prataparudra II, presided over a wealthy and culturally vibrant kingdom renowned for its diamond mines (the famed Golconda mines were within Kakatiya territory), magnificent temple architecture, and martial tradition.<sup><a href="sources.html#khusrau-khazain" class="citation">[2]</a></sup>

            Malik Kafur launched from Devagiri in late 1309 with a massive force. The Kakatiya army initially offered fierce resistance. Prataparudra's forces, well-versed in defending their fortress capital, engaged the invaders in multiple engagements. However, Kafur's superior numbers and cavalry eventually overwhelmed the Kakatiya defenses.

Amir Khusrau describes the plunder in lavish detail: hundreds of elephants, thousands of horses, vast quantities of gold, silver, pearls, and precious gems.

            Several historians have proposed that the legendary Koh-i-Noor diamond &mdash; one of the most famous gems in world history, now set in the British Crown Jewels &mdash; may have originated from the Kakatiya treasury and entered the Delhi Sultanate's possession through Malik Kafur's plunder of Warangal. The Golconda diamond mines, located within Kakatiya territory, were the world's primary source of diamonds in this period. While the provenance cannot be established with certainty, the theory remains a compelling possibility supported by circumstantial evidence.<sup><a href="sources.html#habib-agrarian" class="citation">[5]</a></sup>

It would be fully absorbed into the Delhi Sultanate in a second campaign in 1323 CE under Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq's general Ulugh Khan. The plunder from Warangal was among the largest single wealth transfers in medieval Indian history.

            Fresh from the plunder of Warangal, Malik Kafur turned his army south toward the Hoysala kingdom in present-day Karnataka.

Others &mdash; the Yadavas, the Kakatiyas, the Hoysalas, the Pandyas &mdash; were reduced to vassalage or destroyed within a generation.

            The wealth extracted funded Khilji's massive building projects in Delhi, his enormous standing army, and the apparatus of control that kept his empire together. But the cost to Indian civilization &mdash; in cultural heritage destroyed, in populations massacred or enslaved, in the disruption of artistic and intellectual traditions &mdash; was beyond calculation.<sup><a href="sources.html#khusrau-khazain" class="citation">[2]</a></sup>

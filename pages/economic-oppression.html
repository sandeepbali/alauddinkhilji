          </div>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            What separates Alauddin Khilji's economic policies from those of other medieval rulers is their explicitly stated purpose. This was not taxation for revenue, not market regulation for stability, and not surveillance for law and order. According to the primary sources, particularly the court historian Ziauddin Barani, these policies were conceived and implemented with a single, clearly articulated goal: to reduce the Hindu population to such a state of destitution that they would lack the material resources to resist, rebel, or even maintain basic dignity.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Barani, who served in the Delhi Sultanate's court and had direct access to official policy deliberations, recorded in his <em>Tarikh-i-Firoz Shahi</em> (completed circa 1357 CE) the explicit rationale behind Khilji's economic measures. Unlike later apologists who would frame these policies as pragmatic governance, Barani presented them as ideologically motivated &mdash; rooted in a deliberate strategy to neutralize the Hindu population as a political and military force by stripping them of all economic capacity.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

              &ldquo;The Hindus should be made so poor that they are unable to maintain their families with dignity, to think of rebellion, or to conspire against the Sultan. They should not possess enough wealth to keep horses, wear fine clothes, or enjoy any of the luxuries of life.&rdquo;

          </div>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            This was not an offhand remark or a private sentiment. Barani records this as the governing philosophy from which an entire architecture of economic control was derived. Khilji reportedly consulted with his advisors, including the qazi Mughisuddin of Bayana, on how to keep the Hindu population permanently subjugated. The answer was systematic economic strangulation &mdash; a set of interlocking policies designed to extract maximum wealth while leaving the population too impoverished to maintain weapons, horses, or any means of organized resistance.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>

            <p class="callout__text">
              The economic oppression under Khilji was not an unintended consequence of war or poor governance. Barani's account makes clear that impoverishment was the stated objective &mdash; a policy designed with full awareness of its devastating human impact. The taxation rates, market controls, and surveillance mechanisms were all calibrated to achieve this single goal: the permanent subjugation of the Hindu majority through poverty.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Khilji's approach represented a departure even from the already heavy-handed taxation practices of the early Delhi Sultanate. Previous sultans, including Iltutmish and Balban, had imposed the <em>jizya</em> (a religious tax on non-Muslims) and various land taxes, but none had articulated the explicit goal of rendering an entire population destitute. Khilji transformed taxation from a tool of revenue into a weapon of subjugation, creating what modern historians have described as one of the most oppressive fiscal regimes in medieval world history.<sup><a href="sources.html#lal" class="citation">[2]</a></sup>

            <h2 class="section-header__title">The Kharaj: <span class="text-gold">50% Land Tax</span></h2>
          </div>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The centerpiece of Khilji's economic oppression was the dramatic increase in the <em>kharaj</em>, the agricultural land tax imposed on Hindu cultivators. Under Alauddin's orders, this tax was raised to a staggering 50% of all agricultural produce &mdash; a rate that, when combined with the multiple other taxes simultaneously imposed, pushed farming communities far beyond the limits of subsistence.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            To understand the enormity of this burden, it is essential to compare it with previous rates. Under the initial Arab and Turkic conquests, land tax rates in India typically ranged between one-sixth (approximately 16%) and one-third (approximately 33%) of agricultural output, varying by region and ruler. Even in the broader Islamic world, the <em>kharaj</em> was traditionally understood to be capped at reasonable levels that allowed cultivators to sustain themselves and their families. The Hindu legal tradition under the <em>Dharmashastra</em> texts had long established one-sixth of produce as the normative royal share.<sup><a href="sources.html#habib" class="citation">[3]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Khilji shattered these precedents. By raising the <em>kharaj</em> to 50%, he ensured that half of everything a Hindu farmer grew &mdash; the grain, the pulses, the oilseeds, the cotton &mdash; went directly to the sultanate's treasury. But the 50% <em>kharaj</em> was only the beginning. Simultaneously, Khilji imposed or increased several additional taxes that compounded the burden into something nearly unendurable.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>

          <p class="mt-2xl" data-aos="fade-up">
            The <em>jizya</em>, the poll tax levied exclusively on non-Muslims, was rigorously enforced and expanded in its application. Where previous rulers had sometimes exempted Brahmins and the very poor, Khilji ensured universal collection. The <em>ghari</em> (house tax) was a separate levy on every Hindu household, calculated according to the size and value of the dwelling. The <em>charai</em> (grazing tax) targeted livestock &mdash; the cattle, buffaloes, goats, and sheep that were essential to agricultural life and represented a farmer's accumulated savings.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

            <div class="callout__title">The Combined Burden</div>
            <p class="callout__text">
              When the 50% kharaj, the jizya, the ghari, and the charai were combined, Hindu farming families were left with barely enough to survive. Barani himself records that under these taxation policies, the wives of <em>khuts</em> (landholders) and <em>muqaddams</em> (village headmen) &mdash; who had once been prosperous members of rural society &mdash; were reduced to working as servants in the homes of Muslim officials. The systematic extraction was so thorough that even modest savings became impossible.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The enforcement mechanisms were equally severe. Tax collectors (<em>amils</em>) were dispatched to every village with explicit instructions to collect the full assessed amount without exception. Khilji instituted a system of measurement and assessment that left no room for underreporting. Land was surveyed, crop yields were estimated by state officials, and the 50% share was calculated and extracted with bureaucratic precision. Failure to pay resulted in confiscation of property, imprisonment, and physical punishment.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The impact on the Hindu agricultural communities was devastating. Farmers who had sustained their families for generations found themselves unable to retain seeds for the next planting season. Livestock &mdash; draft animals essential for plowing and transport &mdash; were sold off to meet tax obligations. The once-prosperous village headmen (<em>muqaddams</em> and <em>khuts</em>) who had served as the backbone of rural Indian administration and community life were reduced to penury. Barani records that these formerly respected figures could no longer afford to ride horses, wear decent clothing, or chew betel leaves &mdash; a marker of even modest social standing in medieval India.<sup><a href="sources.html#lal" class="citation">[2]</a></sup>

          </div>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Alauddin Khilji's market control system was among the most elaborate and coercive price-fixing regimes in pre-modern history. While apologists have sometimes framed these measures as visionary economic policy &mdash; an early experiment in price stabilization &mdash; the primary sources reveal a system designed to serve two interconnected purposes: to provision Khilji's massive standing army at artificially low cost, and to further impoverish the Hindu merchant and producer classes by forcing them to sell goods well below market value.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The scale and specificity of the system were extraordinary. Khilji established three entirely separate, regulated markets in Delhi, each under its own set of administrators and controllers:<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <div class="grid-3" data-aos="fade-up">

            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="mt-2xl" data-aos="fade-up">
            To administer this vast apparatus, Khilji created a dedicated government department: the <em>Diwan-i-Riyasat</em> (Department of Market Control). This was headed by a senior official, Malik Yaqub, who functioned as a minister of commerce with sweeping powers over all trade and pricing. Under him operated a hierarchy of controllers, inspectors, and informants whose collective purpose was to ensure that no merchant, shopkeeper, or farmer deviated from the prices set by the sultan.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The <em>Shahna-i-Mandi</em> (Market Controller) oversaw the day-to-day operations of the grain market, ensuring that fixed prices were maintained. Separate officials were appointed for the cloth and goods market, and for the horse and cattle market. Each of these controllers had the authority to arrest, flog, and imprison any trader found violating the price controls.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Barani provides remarkably detailed accounts of the fixed prices. Wheat was set at 7.5 <em>jitals</em> per <em>mann</em>, rice at 5 <em>jitals</em> per <em>mann</em>, and barley at 4 <em>jitals</em> per <em>mann</em> &mdash; prices that represented a fraction of their prevailing market value. Cloth prices were similarly depressed, with fine textiles required to be sold at rates that left weavers and merchants with negligible margins. These artificially low prices were maintained not through subsidy or economic efficiency, but through raw coercion: the threat of brutal punishment for any deviation.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <div class="callout callout--warning" data-aos="fade-up">
            <div class="callout__title">Who Bore the Cost?</div>
            <p class="callout__text">
              The fixed prices benefited Khilji's military apparatus and the ruling class, who could purchase goods at artificially low rates. The cost was borne almost entirely by Hindu farmers, who were forced to sell their produce at below-market prices after already surrendering 50% in kharaj, and by Hindu merchants and artisans, who could not charge prices sufficient to sustain their businesses. What is often presented as "efficient governance" was, in practice, a forced subsidy extracted from the subjugated population to fund the military machine that oppressed them.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The system extended even to the regulation of traders themselves. Grain merchants were required to register with the state, and their families were effectively held hostage to ensure compliance &mdash; any merchant found hoarding grain or selling above the fixed price would see punishment visited not just upon himself, but upon his dependents. Barani records that merchants were required to provide regular reports of their stock, and state agents conducted surprise inspections to verify these accounts. The entire system was designed to eliminate any capacity for independent economic agency among the Hindu trading and farming classes.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>

          </div>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Underpinning Khilji's entire system of economic oppression was an extensive and deeply invasive intelligence apparatus &mdash; the <em>barid</em> system &mdash; that functioned as a pre-modern surveillance state. While the Delhi Sultanate had always maintained intelligence networks, Khilji expanded and weaponized them into a tool of comprehensive social control that penetrated every market, every village, and every gathering of the Hindu population.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The <em>barids</em> (intelligence agents) were deployed throughout the sultanate's territory with instructions to report on every aspect of economic and social life. In the markets, they operated as undercover informants, posing as customers to test whether merchants were charging the official prices. They monitored grain stores, cloth shops, and livestock markets for any sign of hoarding, price manipulation, or unauthorized trade. Any deviation, no matter how minor, was reported and punished with immediate severity.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The punishments for violating Khilji's market controls were deliberately disproportionate and designed to create an atmosphere of terror. Merchants found overcharging were publicly flogged. Barani records instances of traders having flesh cut from their bodies for price violations. Repeat offenders faced imprisonment, confiscation of all property, and in extreme cases, execution. The punishment was not merely retributive &mdash; it was performative, designed to be witnessed by other merchants and serve as a warning against any deviation from the sultan's economic edicts.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <div class="callout callout--warning" data-aos="fade-up">
            <div class="callout__title">Total Social Control</div>
            <p class="callout__text">
              The surveillance extended far beyond the marketplace. Khilji prohibited social gatherings among Hindus, banned the consumption of alcohol (which also targeted Hindu social and religious traditions involving <em>soma</em> and other ritual drinks), and outlawed private assemblies. The barids reported on any gathering of more than a few people. This was not moral regulation &mdash; it was the calculated elimination of every space where dissent could be discussed, resistance could be organized, or collective identity could be maintained.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Khilji also deployed a second layer of intelligence gathering through the <em>munhiyan</em> (secret reporters) who operated independently of the barids and reported directly to the sultan. This dual system meant that even the intelligence agents themselves were under surveillance &mdash; a structure designed to prevent corruption or collusion among the spies and to ensure that the sultan received accurate information about the true state of compliance across his domains.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The result was a climate of pervasive fear. Barani records that Khilji boasted that no one in the markets dared to even speak in whispers about prices, let alone attempt to manipulate them. The Hindu population &mdash; farmers, traders, artisans, and village leaders alike &mdash; lived under constant observation, unable to gather socially, unable to organize economically, and unable to communicate freely. The surveillance system was the enforcement mechanism that made all of Khilji's other economic policies possible: without it, the artificially low prices, the crushing taxation, and the wholesale expropriation of Hindu wealth could not have been sustained.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Even the nobility was not immune. Khilji placed his own officials under surveillance to ensure they did not show leniency to the Hindu population or skim from tax collections. Officials who failed to extract the full assessed taxes were themselves punished. The entire system operated as a self-reinforcing apparatus of control, in which every layer of administration was both an enforcer and a subject of enforcement, all directed toward the singular goal of maximizing the extraction of wealth from the Hindu population.<sup><a href="sources.html#lal" class="citation">[2]</a></sup>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The cumulative effect of Khilji's economic policies was the systematic impoverishment of the Hindu majority &mdash; a transformation so thorough that it dismantled not merely individual wealth but entire social structures that had sustained Indian civilization for centuries. The sources describe a society reduced to subsistence, stripped of agency, and deliberately denied every marker of dignity and status.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The most immediate impact was the elimination of the Hindu capacity for military resistance. By design, the combination of the 50% <em>kharaj</em>, the multiple additional taxes, and the forced sale of goods at below-market prices left Hindu families without the resources to maintain horses or weapons. Khilji explicitly prohibited Hindus from possessing horses, arms, or any equipment that could be used for warfare. The economic policies ensured that even if these prohibitions were somehow evaded, no Hindu family would have the financial means to acquire them.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The village leadership class &mdash; the <em>khuts</em> (landholders), <em>muqaddams</em> (village headmen), and <em>chaudharis</em> (rural chiefs) &mdash; was specifically targeted for destruction. These figures had traditionally served as the pillars of Indian rural society, mediating between cultivators and the state, maintaining local infrastructure, administering justice, and preserving cultural continuity. Under Khilji's taxation regime, they were stripped of their accumulated wealth, their social authority, and their capacity to fulfill any of these roles. Barani records with evident satisfaction that these once-proud figures were reduced to walking on foot, wearing coarse clothing, and performing manual labor.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>

              &ldquo;The Hindu was to be left unable to keep a horse, to wear fine clothes, to carry arms, to use betel, or to possess any luxury. The <em>khuts</em>, <em>muqaddams</em>, and <em>chaudharis</em> were not able to ride on horseback, to find drink, to wear fine clothes, or to enjoy any of the comforts they had once known.&rdquo;

          </div>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Dress restrictions formed another layer of humiliation. Hindus were forbidden from wearing fine garments, using ornaments, or displaying any outward sign of prosperity. These were not merely sumptuary laws of the kind found in many medieval societies; they were enforced markers of subjugation, designed to make the Hindu population's inferior status visible in every public interaction. A Hindu who appeared too well-dressed could be reported by the <em>barids</em> and subjected to investigation and punishment.<sup><a href="sources.html#lal" class="citation">[2]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Wealth confiscation went beyond systematic taxation. Khilji's agents conducted periodic searches and seizures of Hindu households, confiscating any accumulated gold, silver, or valuables that exceeded what the state deemed appropriate for a Hindu to possess. This created a perpetual condition of economic insecurity &mdash; even if a family managed to save a small amount through extraordinary frugality, that savings was always at risk of arbitrary confiscation. The psychological impact was as devastating as the material loss: the message was clear that Hindus had no right to prosperity, no security in their possessions, and no recourse against the state.<sup><a href="sources.html#habib" class="citation">[3]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The impact on Hindu women was particularly severe. As families were impoverished, women from once-respectable households were forced into domestic service in the homes of Muslim officials and nobles. Barani records that the wives and daughters of <em>khuts</em> and <em>muqaddams</em> &mdash; women who had once managed their own households with dignity &mdash; were reduced to working as servants. This deliberate degradation of social status was not incidental; it was part of the broader project of dismantling every structure that sustained Hindu communal life, identity, and self-respect.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The economic devastation inflicted by Alauddin Khilji's policies did not end with his death in 1316 CE. While some of the most extreme market controls were relaxed under his successors, the structural damage to Indian economic life &mdash; particularly to the Hindu agricultural and merchant classes &mdash; persisted for generations and created vulnerabilities that subsequent rulers would exploit.<sup><a href="sources.html#lal" class="citation">[2]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The destruction of the village leadership class proved particularly enduring. The <em>khuts</em>, <em>muqaddams</em>, and <em>chaudharis</em> had served as the administrative, economic, and cultural backbone of Indian rural society for centuries. By stripping these figures of their wealth, authority, and social standing, Khilji did not merely impoverish individuals &mdash; he dismantled the institutional framework through which Indian communities had governed themselves, maintained irrigation systems, resolved disputes, and transmitted cultural knowledge. Rebuilding this class and these institutions after Khilji's death proved difficult, as the precedent of aggressive state extraction had been established and subsequent sultans &mdash; including Muhammad bin Tughlaq and Firoz Shah Tughlaq &mdash; continued many of the same fiscal practices, even if at somewhat reduced intensity.<sup><a href="sources.html#habib" class="citation">[3]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Khilji's policies also established a template for economic extraction that would be replicated and adapted by later rulers across the subcontinent. The principle that the state could impose taxation rates designed not for revenue but for subjugation &mdash; that economic policy could be openly weaponized against a specific religious community &mdash; became embedded in the political culture of the Delhi Sultanate and its successor states. Firoz Shah Tughlaq, who ruled from 1351 to 1388, continued many of Khilji's discriminatory taxation practices. The Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, ruling three and a half centuries later, would reimpose the jizya and institute similar policies of economic discrimination against Hindus, drawing on the same ideological tradition that Khilji had pioneered.<sup><a href="sources.html#lal" class="citation">[2]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <div class="callout callout--info" data-aos="fade-up">
            <div class="callout__title">Patterns of Exploitation</div>
            <p class="callout__text">
              Historians have noted structural parallels between the economic extraction practiced by the Delhi Sultanate and the later colonial exploitation by the British East India Company. While the ideological frameworks differed, the mechanisms were strikingly similar: crushing agricultural taxation, forced sale of produce at below-market prices, destruction of indigenous manufacturing and trade networks, and the creation of a surveillance apparatus to enforce compliance. The centuries of Sultanate-era economic oppression had already weakened Indian economic structures and social institutions, making the subcontinent more vulnerable to subsequent waves of exploitation.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The destruction of Hindu merchant guilds (<em>shrenis</em>) during Khilji's reign had long-lasting effects on Indian trade and manufacturing. These guilds had functioned as self-governing bodies that regulated quality, set fair prices, provided credit, and maintained trade networks spanning the subcontinent. By subjecting merchants to state control, surveillance, and forced pricing, Khilji shattered these indigenous economic institutions. Their decline reduced India's capacity for organized internal trade and weakened the commercial infrastructure that had made the subcontinent one of the wealthiest regions in the medieval world.<sup><a href="sources.html#habib" class="citation">[3]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The agricultural devastation was equally enduring. The 50% <em>kharaj</em> and the associated taxes forced farmers into survival-mode cultivation, discouraging investment in land improvement, irrigation, or crop diversification. When farmers cannot retain sufficient surplus to invest in their own productivity, agricultural development stagnates. The evidence suggests that agricultural productivity in the regions most affected by Khilji's policies took generations to recover, and in some areas, the patterns of impoverishment became self-perpetuating as degraded land, depleted livestock, and destroyed rural institutions created a cycle of poverty that outlasted the policies that had initiated it.<sup><a href="sources.html#habib" class="citation">[3]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Perhaps most significantly, Khilji's economic policies established the ideological precedent that the Hindu population existed to be taxed, controlled, and exploited for the benefit of the ruling Muslim elite. This was not merely an economic arrangement but a political and theological statement about the place of Hindus in the sultanate's social order. The normalization of this ideology &mdash; the idea that differential economic treatment based on religion was not merely acceptable but divinely mandated &mdash; cast a long shadow over Indian history, influencing economic policy and communal relations for centuries after Khilji's death.<sup><a href="sources.html#lal" class="citation">[2]</a></sup>

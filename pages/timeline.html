The breakthrough came through treachery: two of Hammir's generals, Ranmal and Ratipala, defected to Alauddin's side. As the fort fell, Rajput women performed jauhar (self-immolation) rather than face capture. Hammir Dev fought to the death. Temples within the fort were destroyed.</p>

                <p>Continuing his devastating march south, Kafur attacked the Hoysala capital of Dvarasamudra (modern Halebidu in Karnataka). The Hoysala king Veera Ballala III was forced to surrender and pay a colossal tribute. The famous Hoysala temples &mdash; masterpieces of Indian architecture with their intricate sculptural programs &mdash; were vulnerable to despoliation. The wealth of South India, accumulated over centuries of stable rule, was systematically stripped.</p>

                <p>In the most ambitious military campaign of the Delhi Sultanate to date, Kafur pushed all the way to Madurai in modern Tamil Nadu. The Pandya kingdom, torn by an internal succession dispute between Sundara Pandya and Vira Pandya, could not mount effective resistance. Kafur sacked Madurai, plundering the famous Meenakshi Temple and other sacred sites. The quantity of plunder was described by Khusrau as exceeding imagination. This marked the farthest south that Delhi's power had ever reached.</p>

                <p>With the vast plunder from southern campaigns, Khilji embarked on ambitious building projects. The Alai Darwaza (a monumental gateway to the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque complex) was completed in 1311. He also began the Alai Minar, intended to be twice the height of the Qutub Minar, but it was never completed. The Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque itself had been built using pillars and materials from 27 demolished Hindu and Jain temples &mdash; a fact visible in the surviving carvings and architectural elements to this day.</p>

                <p>In his final years, Alauddin's health declined severely. Malik Kafur increasingly controlled state affairs. When Alauddin died in January 1316, Kafur attempted to seize power by blinding the sultan's sons and placing an infant on the throne. However, Kafur was assassinated within 35 days by loyalists of the royal family. The Khilji dynasty itself collapsed shortly after, replaced by the Tughlaqs in 1320. But the damage inflicted during Alauddin's 20-year reign had already permanently altered the course of Indian civilization.</p>

            For decades, the story of Alauddin Khilji that reached most Indians was a carefully curated version &mdash; stripped of its most uncomfortable truths, repackaged as a tale of administrative genius, and presented through the lens of a love story that never existed. This chapter examines the gap between what you were told and what the historical record actually contains.
          </p>
          <p>
            The narrative surrounding Alauddin Khilji in Indian public consciousness has been shaped by three powerful forces: the state-controlled education system, the entertainment industry, and a political establishment that found it convenient to blur the lines between historical accuracy and ideological comfort. Understanding how this sanitization happened is the first step toward reclaiming the truth.

            Open any standard NCERT history textbook used in Indian schools, and you will find Alauddin Khilji described primarily as an &ldquo;efficient administrator&rdquo; and a &ldquo;pioneer of market reforms.&rdquo; His elaborate price-control system &mdash; which was in reality a mechanism of economic subjugation &mdash; is presented as a forward-thinking policy that kept prices low for consumers. His military campaigns are summarized as &ldquo;expansion of the Delhi Sultanate&rdquo; with little mention of the devastation left in their wake.

          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The Class VII and Class XII NCERT textbooks dedicate considerable space to Khilji's market reforms, describing his system of price controls on grain, cloth, horses, and cattle. Students learn about the efficiency of his spy network in enforcing these prices. What the textbooks fail to mention is the purpose behind these controls: to keep the Hindu population so impoverished that they could not afford to organize any resistance.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani-tarikh" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>

            How the 2018 film Padmaavat transformed a historical catastrophe into a spectacle of romance and grandeur, further distancing the public from historical truth.

            In January 2018, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's <em>Padmaavat</em> released to massive commercial success, earning over 585 crore rupees worldwide. The film, starring Ranveer Singh as Alauddin Khilji, Deepika Padukone as Rani Padmavati, and Shahid Kapoor as Maharawal Ratan Singh, became the lens through which an entire generation encountered this historical period. For the vast majority of its audience, this was their primary &mdash; and often only &mdash; engagement with the events of Khilji's reign.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Ranveer Singh's portrayal presented Khilji as a charismatic, almost magnetic villain &mdash; brutal yet fascinating, repulsive yet strangely compelling. The performance was widely praised and won numerous awards. But in focusing on the personal drama &mdash; Khilji's obsession with the legendary beauty of Rani Padmavati &mdash; the film achieved something the textbooks alone could not: it made the era <em>entertaining</em>. The destruction of Chittor, in which historical accounts record approximately 30,000 civilians massacred, became a backdrop for a love story.<sup><a href="sources.html#khusrau-khazain" class="citation">[2]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The film opens and closes on the personal drama. There is no mention of the Gujarat campaign (1299 CE) and its wholesale destruction of temples. There is no reference to the Deccan invasions that would devastate the Yadava, Kakatiya, Hoysala, and Pandya kingdoms. The systematic policy of impoverishing the Hindu population &mdash; documented in Barani's own words &mdash; is entirely absent. Instead, the audience leaves the theater having witnessed a grand love story set against a vaguely medieval backdrop.

            <p class="callout__text">
              The film <em>Padmaavat</em> is based on Malik Muhammad Jayasi's 16th-century Sufi poem <em>Padmavat</em> (1540 CE), written over 200 years after Khilji's siege of Chittor. The poem is a work of allegorical fiction, not a historical account. By choosing this fictional framing over actual historical sources like Barani and Amir Khusrau, the film replaced documented reality with romantic legend &mdash; and audiences assumed they were watching history.

          <h2 class="section-header__title">What Was <span class="text-gold">Deliberately</span> Hidden</h2>
          <p class="section-header__subtitle">
            The systematic omission of temple destructions, forced conversions, and economic exploitation from Indian education was not an oversight &mdash; it was a deliberate choice driven by political considerations.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-body">
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The question is not simply what was left out of textbooks, but <em>why</em> it was left out. The omissions in Indian history education regarding Alauddin Khilji &mdash; and indeed the entire Delhi Sultanate and Mughal period &mdash; were the result of deliberate editorial decisions made over decades, shaped by a particular vision of Indian nationhood that prioritized a constructed narrative of communal harmony over historical accuracy.
          </p>

          <h3 data-aos="fade-up">Temple Destructions: Erased from Memory</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            During Alauddin Khilji's twenty-year reign, hundreds of Hindu and Jain temples were destroyed across the subcontinent. The campaign against Gujarat alone (1299 CE) resulted in the desecration of major temples in Somnath, Dwarka, and across the region. Malik Kafur's campaigns into the Deccan (1306&ndash;1311 CE) devastated temples in Devagiri, Warangal, Dvarasamudra, and Madurai. The great Meenakshi temple complex was plundered, the Kakatiya temples at Warangal were looted of centuries of accumulated wealth, and the Hoysala temples faced similar destruction.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani-tarikh" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            These are not allegations made by later historians with an axe to grind. They are recorded with pride by the Muslim court historians of the period. Amir Khusrau describes the destruction of temples as a righteous act, and Barani documents Khilji's own satisfaction at reducing Hindu places of worship.<sup><a href="sources.html#khusrau-khazain" class="citation">[2]</a></sup> Yet in standard Indian school textbooks, these documented events are either absent entirely or mentioned in a single euphemistic sentence.
          </p>

          <h3 data-aos="fade-up">Forced Conversions and Religious Persecution</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The Delhi Sultanate period, particularly under rulers like Alauddin Khilji, saw systematic religious persecution of the Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist populations. Barani records that Khilji considered implementing forced mass conversion but was advised against it only on the grounds of practical governance &mdash; not out of any respect for religious freedom. The jizya (religious tax on non-Muslims) was rigorously enforced, adding to the already crushing burden of the kharaj. Hindu religious practices were restricted; social gatherings and celebrations among Hindus were monitored and often prohibited.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani-tarikh" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <div class="callout callout--warning" data-aos="fade-up">
            <div class="callout__title">Why Was This Hidden?</div>
            <p class="callout__text">
              Post-independence India adopted an approach to history education that prioritized national unity above all else. The architects of Indian education policy &mdash; influenced by the political need to maintain harmony between India's Hindu majority and Muslim minority &mdash; made a conscious decision to de-emphasize the religious nature of medieval conflicts. The result was a textbook narrative in which the Delhi Sultanate became primarily a story of &ldquo;administration&rdquo; and &ldquo;cultural synthesis,&rdquo; with the systematic religious persecution stripped away. This was not done out of ignorance &mdash; the primary sources were well known to the historians who wrote these textbooks. It was done out of a belief that historical truth was less important than the political project of building a &ldquo;secular&rdquo; national identity.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3 data-aos="fade-up">Economic Exploitation: The Hidden Tax Regime</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Perhaps the most insidious form of Khilji's persecution was economic. Barani documents that Khilji levied a 50% kharaj (land tax) on the Hindu farming population &mdash; far beyond what was customary even by Sultanate standards. In addition, he imposed the jizya (religious tax on non-Muslims), a house tax, and a grazing tax. The explicit, stated purpose of this tax regime, as recorded by Barani from Khilji's own words, was to reduce the Hindu population to such poverty that they could not maintain their families with dignity, let alone organize resistance.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani-tarikh" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            This was not merely extractive taxation of the kind practiced by many medieval rulers. It was targeted economic warfare against a specific religious community. The tax collectors were given powers to search Hindu homes and confiscate any wealth deemed &ldquo;excess.&rdquo; Barani records that the policy was successful: Hindu landholders were reduced to penury, their women forced to work in Muslim households, and any sign of prosperity among the Hindu population was treated as evidence of evasion requiring punishment.
          </p>

          <div class="source-quote" data-aos="fade-up">
            <p class="source-quote__text">
              &ldquo;The Hindu was to be so reduced as to be left unable to keep a horse, to wear fine clothes, or to enjoy any of the luxuries of life. No Hindu could hold up his head.&rdquo;

          <h3 data-aos="fade-up">The &ldquo;Secularism&rdquo; Narrative</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The omission of these facts from mainstream education was not accidental. In post-1947 India, the writing of history textbooks became a deeply political exercise. Successive governments, particularly those aligned with the Indian National Congress, promoted a vision of Indian history that emphasized &ldquo;composite culture&rdquo; and &ldquo;syncretic traditions.&rdquo; Within this framework, acknowledging the religious dimensions of medieval violence became politically inconvenient.
          </p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            The result was that generations of Indian students graduated without knowing that their own country's primary historical sources &mdash; written by the court historians of these very rulers &mdash; documented systematic religious persecution, temple destruction, and targeted economic oppression. The sources were never lost or unavailable; they were simply not included in the curriculum. Students were taught about Khilji's market reforms but not about the purpose those reforms served. They learned about his military conquests but not about the massacres that accompanied them.

            The primary sources for Alauddin Khilji's reign are remarkably detailed, and they come overwhelmingly from Muslim historians who wrote either during his reign or shortly after. These were not hostile foreign chroniclers or later revisionists &mdash; they were the court-appointed record keepers of the Sultanate itself. Their accounts were written not as criticism, but as celebration. And it is precisely this fact that makes them so damning by modern ethical standards.

          <h3 data-aos="fade-up">Ziauddin Barani &mdash; Tarikh-i-Firoz Shahi (c. 1357 CE)</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Ziauddin Barani served in the court of Muhammad bin Tughlaq and wrote his chronicle approximately four decades after Khilji's death. His work is considered one of the most important primary sources for the Delhi Sultanate period. Barani provides detailed accounts of Khilji's administrative policies, his tax regime, his treatment of the Hindu population, and his military campaigns. It is Barani who records Khilji's explicit statements about the need to impoverish Hindus and keep them subjugated.<sup><a href="sources.html#barani-tarikh" class="citation">[1]</a></sup>

          <h3 data-aos="fade-up">Amir Khusrau &mdash; Khazain-ul-Futuh (c. 1311 CE)</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Amir Khusrau was Alauddin Khilji's own court poet and a direct eyewitness to many of the events he describes. His <em>Khazain-ul-Futuh</em> (&ldquo;Treasures of Victory&rdquo;) provides first-hand accounts of the military campaigns, the destruction of temples, and the plunder of Hindu kingdoms. Khusrau wrote as an admirer and propagandist for Khilji, which means his accounts of violence and destruction are presented positively &mdash; making them all the more reliable as evidence of what actually occurred.<sup><a href="sources.html#khusrau-khazain" class="citation">[2]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <h3 data-aos="fade-up">Isami &mdash; Futuh-us-Salatin (c. 1350 CE)</h3>
          <p data-aos="fade-up">
            Isami's poetic chronicle of the Sultanate period provides additional documentation of Khilji's campaigns and their devastating impact on Hindu society. Written in the Deccan, Isami's perspective offers a view from the territories that bore the brunt of Malik Kafur's southern campaigns under Khilji's orders.<sup><a href="sources.html#isami-futuh" class="citation">[3]</a></sup>

            The chapters that follow will draw extensively on these and other primary sources to reconstruct the complete, unvarnished history of Alauddin Khilji's reign &mdash; from his blood-soaked rise to power through the murder of his own uncle, to the systematic campaigns of temple destruction, economic exploitation, and religious persecution that defined his two decades on the throne. This is the history that your textbooks chose not to tell you. But the sources are there, and they speak for themselves.
